In this talk, we explore a rich spectrum of sequence analysis problems that extend and generalize the classic Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. Given a sequence of distinct numerical elements, the LIS problem aims to find a subsequence that is strictly increasing and has the maximum possible length. For example, given the sequence (3, 5, 2, 1, 9, 7), one LIS answer is (3, 5, 9), another is (3, 5, 7), both of which have a length of 3. This problem was first introduced by Schensted in 1961 and has since been widely studied.

Recently, various extensions of the LIS problem have been proposed to better reflect real-world scenarios. For instance, in stock market analysis, the overall trend may be upward, but occasional small declines are common. To model such behavior, the longest almost increasing subsequence (LaIS) was proposed, which allows small decreases in an increasing sequence. In agriculture or climate analysis, crop yields or temperature may exhibit periodic trends. To capture this, variants such as LIS/LaIS with sliding windows have been introduced. In stock market analysis, one might also be interested in identifying multiple segments of rising and falling trends. Thus, the longest wave subsequence (LWS) has been proposed. For more detailed stock price behavior, one may consider both the lowest and highest prices in each day, treating each data point as an interval instead of a single value. This leads to the longest increasing interval subsequence problem (LIIS).

We will introduce the following problems:
Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Longest Almost Increasing Subsequence (LaIS)
Almost Order Preserving Matching
Longest Wave Subsequence
Longest Almost Wave Subsequence
Longest Increasing Interval Subsequence
LIS with Sliding Windows
LaIS with Sliding Windows

In addition, we will also explore two-sequence problems, where the goal is not only to satisfy the above structural constraints but also to ensure that corresponding elements from both sequences match. Examples include longest common increasing subsequence (LCIS), longest common wave subsequence (LCWS), and etc.</section><br data-v-4eb7a99f=""><br data-v-4eb7a99f=""><br data-v-4eb7a99f=""><!--]--></div></div><!--]--></div></div><!--]--></div>
