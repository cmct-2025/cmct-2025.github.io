        <h4>Submission Guideline</h4>

        All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.<br />
        Submission link: <b>TBD</b><br />
        Templates, sample files: <a
          href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-uJpkkvIbmP1hxGBnCQsZ5GXMH49iurY?usp=drive_link"
          target="_blank">link</a><br />
        <p><b>The maximum length of the submission (including references, but excluding the optional appendix) is 6
            pages. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in an appendix to be read by the program
            committee members at their discretion. Submissions that deviate from these guidelines risk being rejected
            without consideration of their merits. Submission will be through the Microsoft CMT system. The submission
            process may require registration to create a CMT account prior to submission.</b></p>
